Ai major project- This is the project of facial emotion recognition. I've made this project with the help of the following libraries-
1) opencv. Used for computer vision.
2) streamlit. Used for making web applications.
3) tensorflow. Used for model building 
4) numpy. Used in array mathematics.
5) pandas. It's a dataframe.

This zip file includes full code of my project with a video for better explanation of how my project works and also includes a dataset.

Working-
First you have to train the model.
Second save the trained model in a json file.
Third import the Json file in the main code where open cv is used for vision. I used haar cascade classifier for face detection.
Fourth install streamlit and import in the same code to run this web application on your Chrome browser.

Thanks.


Face_reco_lib- This is a ipynb file including full Working code of facial recognition using face_recognition library. 
Here you may see an error at the end of the code state permission denied. this is due to jypeter upgraded version after downgrade your jypeter notebook this code works completely fine.
Remember this library needs dlib package to be installed first then only you can install face_recognition library. 
This also requires a GPU to work fast you consider using Google colab. But Google colab only works upto 12 hrs so i faced GPU times out a lot of time. Currently my GPU times out and it's
Taking more time to run on jypeter notebook.

Thanks.
